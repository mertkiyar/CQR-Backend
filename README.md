# ClassQRoom Backend

This project is a Spring Boot based REST API developed for a attendance management system.

The backend is responsible for handling users, courses, enrollments, attendance sessions and attendance records.
PostgreSQL is used as the primary database, and the database schema is designed manually with strict rules and triggers.

## Current Status

- Spring Boot project initialized
- PostgreSQL connection configured
- Core database schema is under active development
- Business rules are enforced primarily at the database level (constraints, triggers)

## Planned Features

- Student and lecturer management
- Course and enrollment management
- Attendance sessions (QR, NFC, 6-Digit-Code)
- Secure attendance validation
- REST API for mobile (Android) client

## Tech Stack

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL
- Maven

## Notes

This README will be expanded as the database design and API endpoints are finalized.
